# Complexity in Big O Notation

### `isPalindrome(x int) bool`

1. **Checking if x is less than or equal to 0**: This is a constant time operation, \(O(1)\).

2. **Conversion of integer to string**: The `strconv.Itoa(x)` function converts the integer \(x\) to its string representation. This operation has a time complexity of \(O(\log_{10}x)\), as the number of digits in \(x\) is proportional to \(\log_{10}x\).

3. **Calling `reverse(value)`**: The complexity of this call will be detailed separately below.

4. **Comparison of strings**: The comparison `value == reverse(value)` compares two strings of length \(n\), where \(n\) is the number of digits in \(x\). This has a time complexity of \(O(n)\).

### `reverse(text string) (result string)`

1. **Iteration over the string**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `text`, which has a length of \(n\). This takes \(O(n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of characters in the string.

2. **String concatenation**: Inside the loop, the operation `result = string(char) + result` involves creating a new string by concatenating a character to the front of the result string. This is an \(O(n)\) operation because each concatenation involves copying the entire result string, which grows linearly with the number of characters.

Overall, the loop performs \(O(n)\) concatenations, each taking up to \(O(n)\) time, leading to a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) for the `reverse` function.

### Combined Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Conversion of integer to string: \(O(\log_{10}x)\)
  - Reverse function: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n = \log_{10}x\)
  - String comparison: \(O(n)\), where \(n = \log_{10}x\)

Combining these, the overall time complexity of the `isPalindrome` function is dominated by the reverse function, giving it an overall complexity of \(O((\log_{10}x)^2)\).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity for the conversion of integer to string is \(O(\log_{10}x)\) because the string representation of the number takes up space proportional to the number of digits.
  - The reverse function uses additional space to store the reversed string, which is also \(O(n) = O(\log_{10}x)\).
  
Thus, the overall space complexity is \(O(\log_{10}x)\).

### Summary

- **Time Complexity**: \(O((\log_{10}x)^2)\)
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(\log_{10}x)\)

This analysis assumes that `x` is a positive integer. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, the function immediately returns `false`, which is a constant time operation \(O(1)\).
