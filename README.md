# LeetCode Playground

This repository serves as a dedicated space for enhancing my algorithmic skills through LeetCode challenges, primarily utilizing Go (Golang). By consistently engaging with a variety of problems, I aim to deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms, thereby improving my problem-solving abilities. This practice not only sharpens my coding proficiency but also prepares me for technical interviews and real-world software development scenarios.


## Neetcode / Blind 75 Questions

In the folder [top-75](./top-75/). My goal is to use this problem list to Pareto (20% that solves 80% of the problems) to learn about data structures and algorithms.

Inspired by the [Youtube channel Neetcode](https://www.youtube.com/c/neetcode).
