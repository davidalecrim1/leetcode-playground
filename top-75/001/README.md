# Two Sum Problem

Hash maps have a constant time look up of O(1). This is great when compared to O(n) using a brute force with two loops.

The downside if the O(n) in memory.

The hash map is a great solution because under the hood it creates a hash for the key with the address of the value, giving a constant time look up of O(1).
